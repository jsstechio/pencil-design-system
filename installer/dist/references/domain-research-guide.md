# Domain Research Guide

How to research any business domain to inform design system decisions. Use this guide during Phase 1 to build a design brief before touching Pencil.

## Research Process

### Step 1 — Web Search

Use `WebSearch` with these query patterns:

```
"[domain] website design trends 2026"
"[domain] brand color palette examples"
"[domain] UI UX best practices"
"best [domain] website designs inspiration"
"[domain] app design case study"
```

For example, for a bakery:
```
"bakery website design trends 2026"
"bakery brand color palette examples"
"artisan bakery UI UX best practices"
```

### Step 2 — Extract the Five Pillars

From search results, document:

1. **Color palette** — 1 primary, 1–2 secondary, 1 accent, neutral scale, semantic colors
2. **Typography** — Display font + body font pairing (see Step 2b for dedicated font research)
3. **Imagery** — Photo subjects, illustration style, texture/pattern use
4. **Screen inventory** — 3–5 screens this business type needs
5. **UI density and tone** — Spacious vs. dense, formal vs. playful

### Step 2b — Font Research (Typography Deep Dive)

**Do NOT just pick fonts from the fallback table.** Run dedicated research to find the best pairing for this specific domain.

#### Font Research Queries

Run 2–3 of these `WebSearch` queries:

```
"[domain] website typography trends 2026"
"best Google Fonts for [domain] website"
"[domain] brand font pairing examples"
"[domain] website design fonts serif sans-serif"
```

For example, for a bakery:
```
"bakery website typography trends 2026"
"best Google Fonts for bakery website"
"artisan bakery brand font pairing examples"
```

#### What to Look For

From the search results, identify:

1. **What top sites in this domain actually use** — Check 3–5 real websites. Note their heading font, body font, and the personality they convey.
2. **Serif vs. sans-serif preference** — Some domains lean heavily serif (bakery, fine dining, fashion), others lean sans-serif (SaaS, fitness, developer tools).
3. **Font personality match** — Does the font's character match the domain's tone? (e.g., a playful rounded font for a kids' brand, a sharp geometric for fintech)
4. **Google Fonts availability** — The font must be available on Google Fonts for broad compatibility.

#### Font Evaluation Criteria

Score each candidate pairing against:

| Criteria | Question |
|----------|----------|
| **Personality** | Does it match the domain's tone? (warm, professional, playful, elegant) |
| **Readability** | Is the body font comfortable at 14–16px for paragraphs? |
| **Contrast** | Do the display and body fonts create clear visual hierarchy? |
| **Availability** | Is it on Google Fonts with sufficient weight options (400, 500, 600, 700)? |
| **Uniqueness** | Does it avoid being generic? (e.g., Inter is safe but unremarkable for a bakery) |

#### Decision Process

1. **Research first** — Run the queries above and note what real sites use.
2. **Pick 2–3 candidates** — Select display + body pairings that match the research.
3. **Validate against the domain** — Does this pairing feel right for a [bakery/SaaS/fitness app]?
4. **Fall back if needed** — If research yields no clear winner, use the Fallback Pairing Table below.
5. **Document the choice** — In the design brief, note: font name, why it was chosen, and the source (research or fallback).

### Step 3 — Compile Design Brief

Write a concise brief (internal reference, not shown to user).

**If the user specified colors or fonts:** Use their values directly — mark them as "user-specified" in the brief. Research still fills in the remaining values (secondary, muted, foreground, etc.) to complement the user's choices.

**If the user gave no preferences:** Use research results + fallback tables.

```
Domain: Bakery
Brand name: [if provided]
Primary color: Warm brown (#8B4513) — trust, warmth, earthiness [source: research / user-specified / fallback]
Secondary: Cream (#FFF8DC) — softness, comfort [source: derived from primary]
Accent: Terracotta (#CD5C5C) — warmth, appetite [source: research / user-specified / fallback]
Fonts: Playfair Display (display) + Nunito (body) [source: research / user-specified / fallback]
Imagery: Artisan bread, pastries, warm wood, flour dust, golden light
Screens: Landing hero, Menu grid, Order/cart, About story, Contact
Tone: Warm, inviting, artisanal, approachable
Density: Spacious, editorial, generous whitespace
```

## Typography Pairing Guide

### Pairing Principles

- **Display + Body**: The display font carries personality; the body font provides readability
- **Contrast rule**: Pair a serif with a sans-serif, or a decorative with a clean geometric
- **Weight balance**: Display fonts can be bold/heavy; body fonts should be regular weight
- **x-height match**: Fonts with similar x-heights pair better

### Fallback Pairing Table

> **Use only as a fallback.** Always run Step 2b font research first. These are sensible defaults if research yields no clear winner.

| Domain | Display Font | Body Font | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Bakery/artisan | Playfair Display | Nunito | Elegant serif + friendly rounded sans |
| Coffee/café | DM Serif Display | Inter | Warm serif + clean modern sans |
| Fine dining | Cormorant Garamond | Lato | Refined serif + versatile sans |
| Casual restaurant | Poppins (700) | Poppins (400) | Single family, weight contrast |
| SaaS / B2B | Inter (700) | Inter (400) | Clean, professional, systematic |
| Developer tools | JetBrains Mono | Inter | Monospace display + clean body |
| AI / startup | Space Grotesk | DM Sans | Futuristic geometric + clean companion |
| Fintech | Outfit | Inter | Modern geometric + trusted neutral |
| Fitness | Oswald | Roboto | Condensed power + clean readability |
| Yoga / wellness | Cormorant | Nunito Sans | Graceful serif + soft sans |
| Fashion | Playfair Display | Raleway | Elegant editorial pairing |
| Real estate | Merriweather | Open Sans | Trustworthy serif + friendly body |
| E-commerce | Poppins | Open Sans | Friendly geometric + versatile body |
| Agency/portfolio | Space Grotesk | Inter | Modern statement + invisible body |
| Education | Quicksand | Nunito | Rounded friendly + approachable body |

### Mono Font

Always set `--font-mono` to `JetBrains Mono` or `Fira Code` regardless of domain. Mono fonts are used for code snippets, data tables, and technical labels.
